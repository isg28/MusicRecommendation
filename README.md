# MusicRecommendation
May 2021 - For my AP Computer Science Principles exam, I developed a Python-based music recommendation program that allows users to create and manage personalized music lists. The program features a simple yet effective user interface where users can add and remove songs based on their preferences. This project deepened my understanding of fundamental programming concepts such as loops, input validation, and list management. Additionally, it showcased my ability to create interactive applications that enhance user experience.
